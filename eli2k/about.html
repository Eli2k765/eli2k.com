                <h1>About this Site</h1>
                <strong>Last updated: May 4th, 2023</strong>
                <article>
                  <div id="contain">
                    <h3>Why I made the Site</h3>
                    <p>Over the past year, I've been compiling
                    extensive notes on a range of subjects, with a
                    particular focus on cybersecurity. Originally,
                    I planned to create a GitBook to share them but
                    decided to take a more involved and independent
                    approach. I had a server and domain that I
                    mainly used for email and a few other services,
                    and adding an Nginx server was relatively easy
                    since it runs on NixOS. I designed the site
                    with inspiration from <a href=
                    "https://sadgrl.online/about/archive/">Sadgrl</a>,
                    which was featured in an article discussing the
                    differences between the "old web" and the "new
                    web." Although the article is no longer
                    available on Wayback Machine, the Sadgrl
                    website is still active.</p>
                    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                    <p>The content on my website consists mostly of
                    slightly revised pages from my notebook, which
                    I used to study for certifications such as
                    OSCP, as well as topics that I found
                    interesting. Since enrolling in WGUs
                    cybersecurity and information assurance
                    program, I plan to share all the notes I take
                    for each course on the website. Currently,
                    there is no way for users to provide feedback
                    or chat with me, but I hope to implement those
                    features in the future. If you'd like to chat,
                    feel free to email me at <a href=
                    "mailto:erodgers@eli2k.com">erodgers@eli2k.com</a>.</p>
