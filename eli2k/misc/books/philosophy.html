                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>During the 17th century, a scientific revolution was already underway with prominent figures such as Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo challenging the biblical accounts of the universe and humanity's central place within it. Ren√© Descartes, born in France in 1596, was heavily influenced by the tension between science and religion of his time. He is considered the father of modern philosophy and a significant figure in the Enlightenment period. Descartes' rationalist views emphasized the use of reason to attain knowledge, famously expressed through his statement "Cogito ergo sum," or "I think, therefore I am." He questioned the Aristotelian method of study and the separation of mathematics from the study of the physical world, seeking to use mathematics in the study of physics. His travels throughout Europe influenced his vision for a new system of mathematics and science, which he first published in Discourse on Method in 1636. His most influential works, Meditations on First Philosophy (1641) and this book, Principles of Philosophy (1644), were developed in response to the new science and its mechanistic and mathematical explanations of the natural world. Descartes simplified the metaphysical picture by arguing that there were only two types of substances in the world: mental substance, whose essence was thinking, and physical substance, whose essence was extension. This allowed him to collapse physics into geometry and develop a new epistemology, or theory of knowledge, that relied on reason and deduction.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <div>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Part I:</strong> This section deals with Descartes' epistemology and metaphysics, and it is the only part of the book that can be classified as "philosophy" by today's standards. In it, he doubts all knowledge to determine what can be known for certain, and he identifies the fact that he exists as one piece of certain knowledge. From this fact and other innate ideas, he proves the existence of God, the reliability of reason, the external world, and the nature of mind and body.</li>
                        <li><strong>Part II:</strong> This section deals with Descartes' natural philosophy or "science," and he lays out the principles of his physics. He argues that body is nothing but extended substance, which allows him to explain every physical phenomenon using simple geometric principles. He also discusses space and motion and their properties, concluding with his three laws of nature.</li>
                        <li><strong>Part III:</strong> In this section, Descartes uses the principles from Part II to deduce the motions of the planets, the composition of elements, and properties of light. He also gives an account of the earth's motion, influenced by Galileo's recent run-in with the Catholic Church.</li>
                        <li><strong>Part IV:</strong> This section applies Descartes' explanatory principles to earth and explains the earth's origin, gravity, magnetism, tides, heat, and conclusions of chemistry. He ends the book with a discussion of human sensations and emotions.</li>
