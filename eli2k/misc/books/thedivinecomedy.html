                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>Dante Alighieri was born in Florence, Italy in 1265 to a moderately wealthy family with a history of political involvement. He fell in love with Beatrice, whose true historical identity is unknown, but she died suddenly in 1290. Dante continued to yearn for her and published Vita Nuova (The New Life) in 1293, describing his tragic love for her. Dante began to seriously study philosophy and became more politically involved in Florence after Beatrice's death. He held several significant public offices during a time of great political unrest in Italy. In 1302, he was exiled for life by the leaders of the Black Guelphs, the political faction in power at the time. He completed Inferno, which depicts an allegorical journey through Hell, around 1314 while in exile. Dante roamed from court to court in Italy, writing and occasionally lecturing, until his death from a sudden illness in 1321.</p><br>
                      <p>The struggle for power in Florence reflected a crisis that affected all of Italy and most of Europe from the twelfth century to the fourteenth century, which was the struggle between church and state for temporal authority. The Guelph party supported the papacy, and the Ghibelline party supported imperial power. The Guelphs were in power in Florence during Dante's time, but by 1290, they had divided into two factions: the Whites (Danteâ€™s party) and the Blacks, who were willing to work with the pope in order to restore their power. Under the direction of Pope Boniface VIII, the Blacks gained control of Florence in 1301, and Dante was exiled within a year. Despite the historical context of the work, Inferno is far from merely a political allegory. It is a landmark in the development of European language and literature, and critics spanning nearly seven centuries have praised its poetic beauty and compass, virtually unmatched by any other medieval poem.</p><br>
                      <p>Inferno is also a universal work that deals with one of the great questions of humanity: the existence of an afterlife and the consequences of our lives on Earth. Dante acknowledges the seeming folly of attempting to write a great poem in vernacular language by entitling his masterpiece The Comedy (the adjective Divine was added in the sixteenth century). The title The Comedy is appropriate in two ways. First, the poem is written in the vernacular, which was considered appropriate only for a comedy. Second, the plot mirrors the flow of a classical comedy, progressing from the horrors of Hell to the joys of Heaven. The Comedy is not exclusively high or low but is a truly universal work that utilizes every available style, as Dante does throughout Inferno.</p>
