                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>Sir Thomas More lived during a period of significant change in Europe, marked by the Renaissance and the rise of humanism. Humanists believed in the power of reason and the dignity of man, challenging the feudal system dominated by the nobility and the Church's strict religious orthodoxy. More's Utopia, written in 1516, described an ideal society on the fictional island of Utopia, which gained significant attention and founded the utopian novel literary tradition. Although it is unclear whether More supported the ideas presented in Utopia, the book criticized the European society he saw around him and reflected the historical context of the time. Interestingly, More opposed Henry VIII's break from the Catholic Church, leading to his execution and martyrdom.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>The book "Utopia" by Sir Thomas More is divided into two books. Book I is a dialogue between More, Giles, and Hythloday in which Hythloday shares his views on the governments of various nations, highlighting the problems in Europe. He believes that his advice would not be accepted in royal councils due to flattery, personal aggrandizement, and political power struggles. Book I ends with a few references to the island of Utopia, which leads to the discussion in Book II.</p>
                      <p>Book II is a detailed account of the island of Utopia as narrated by Hythloday. The island is well-planned with cities, agriculture, and country life. The population is engaged in productive labor, resulting in a six-hour workday, with the exception of government officials and priests. The government is headed by the Prince, elected by the Philarchs. Every person, except for the officials and priests, practices a trade, and all needs are satisfied through this full participation in productive labor. The family is the unit of society, with the oldest member serving as governor. They have slaves who are either criminals or prisoners captured in battle. The Utopians have no private property and no money, with markets functioning as supply houses where anyone can take what they need without payment. They produce an abundance of food, which they export to foreign countries and exchange for gold and silver. Their wealth is used only in times of war. Their education is mainly directed toward useful learning, and they are much given to reading in their leisure hours. The philosophical position that prevails among them enshrines reason as the foundation for all knowledge, and they believe that a life pattern must accord with the dictates of nature. The goal of life is pleasure, but this is restricted only if it proves detrimental to oneself or to others. Marriage is held in the highest regard, and any breach of chastity is severely punished.</p>
