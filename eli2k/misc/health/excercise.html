                    <h2>Main Concepts</h2>
                    <h3>Eccentric Training</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p><a href=
                      "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36107233/">According
                      to a study published in PubMed</a>, "Eccentric
                      training alone is as effective as both
                      concentric and eccentric training" in terms of
                      increasing muscle strength and thickness,
                      despite using only half the training volume.
                      This suggests that one can achieve comparable
                      results with less effort. As a result, I prefer
                      to focus on exercises that can be performed
                      eccentrically. (Eccentric training is a type of
                      muscle contraction where the muscle lengthens
                      as it contracts, typically when lowering a
                      weight or returning to the starting position of
                      an exercise)</p>
                    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>As part of my pre-workout routine, I perform
                      some stretching exercises. My goal is to
                      stretch the muscle group I'll be exercising to
                      warm it up, but I also include more general
                      stretches for improved blood flow and muscle
                      recovery, as well as to reduce the risk of
                      injury. Some of the stretches I do include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Hamstring stretch:</b> Sitting on the
                        floor with one leg extended straight out in
                        front of me, and the other leg bent with the
                        foot flat on the floor, I lean forward and
                        reach for my toes on the extended leg,
                        alternating legs after 15 seconds.</li>
                        <li><b>Quad stretch:</b> Standing on one leg,
                        I bend the knee of the lifted leg to bring my
                        heel towards my butt. Then, I hold my ankle
                        with the hand on the same side of my body and
                        press my hips forward, again alternating legs
                        after 15 seconds.</li>
                        <li><b>Shoulder stretch:</b> Standing, I lift
                        one arm across my chest and use my other arm
                        to gently push the raised arm closer to my
                        chest.</li>
                        <li><b>Cobra stretch:</b> Lying on the floor
                        face-down I assume a push-up position with my
                        upper-body but keep my hips and legs on the
                        floor. I gradually extend my arms until I
                        feel my abs and hips stretching</li>
                        <li><b>Lower back stretch:</b> Lying on my
                        back with both knees bent and both feet flat
                        on the floor, I slowly lift one knee to my
                        chest and hold it with both hands.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Core</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>It's worth noting that most compound
                      exercises, including those listed on this page,
                      can help to improve core strength. By engaging
                      multiple muscle groups at once, compound
                      exercises can work the abdominal muscles, lower
                      back, and hips, all of which are important for
                      core stability. Additionally, incorporating
                      eccentric core exercises, such as slow and
                      controlled lowering movements, can be
                      particularly effective for strengthening the
                      core muscles.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Grip</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>While often overlooked, grip strength is one of the most important factors of overall strength and
                      fitness. Recent studies have suggested that
                      grip strength may be a useful biomarker, as it
                      has been linked to cardiovascular health and
                      mortality. If you're looking to improve your
                      grip strength, there are several exercises you
                      can try, in addition to using grip
                      strengtheners such as <a href=
                      "https://www.amazon.com/TIT-COOPOPE-Hand-Wrist-Strengthener/dp/B09ZL8LXRH?th=1">
                      these ones</a> I personally use. Incorporating
                      grip-strengthening exercises into your workout
                      routine, such as deadlifts, pull-ups, and
                      farmer's walks, can also help to improve grip
                      strength and overall strength and fitness.
                      Check out these studies on the relationship
                      between grip strength and cardiovascular health
                      and mortality for more information: <a href=

                    <h3>Cardio</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>Many people find cardio day long,
                      repetitive, and easy to skip. In order to spend
                      less time working out, I take some shortcuts on
                      cardio day. While I don't have much research to
                      support my approach, I can explain my thoughts
                      in more detail. Let's start with my
                      understanding of cardio:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Cardio involves the heart and lungs
                        supplying oxygen to the muscles, which then
                        use that oxygen.</li>
                        <li>The heart and diaphragm are muscles, and
                        like any other muscle, they can be trained to
                        be stronger.</li>
                        <li>Hypertrophy can be caused by the buildup
                        of lactic acid resulting from anaerobic
                        respiration in an oxygen-deprived
                        environment.</li>
                        <li>When your muscles have low oxygen, your
                        brain signals your heart to beat faster.</li>
                        <li>Your body naturally seeks efficiency and
                        homeostasis.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>Based on this understanding, it makes sense
                      that creating an oxygen-deprived environment is
                      necessary to improve cardio, and this can be
                      achieved by having your muscles use more oxygen
                      than your heart and lungs can supply.</p>
                      <p>One way to achieve this is to deprive
                      yourself of oxygen, using an oxygen-deprivation
                      mask. While I initially used the mask to train
                      for a run at higher elevations, I noticed
                      significant improvements in my times after I
                      stopped wearing it, even though I performed
                      similarly with it on. As a result, I've come to
                      the conclusion that using the mask occasionally
                      during short runs, while potentially risky, can
                      lead to greater gains in a shorter period of
                      time.</p>
