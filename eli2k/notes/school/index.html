                <p class="alert">An overview of how I approached
                classes in the Cybersecurity and Information
                Assurance program at WGU. <sup>O</sup> represents
                classes that have an Objective assessment and
                <sup>P</sup> represents classes that have a
                Performance assessment.</p>
                <p class="alert">Each class has a link to the notes
                I took for that class and a brief summary on my
                thoughts. Generally, my approach was to do the
                Course Planning Guide for every class, any section that I performed poorly in I would look up recommended study material on the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/WGU/">WGU</a> subreddit. After glancing over whatever resources I could find, and before taking any notes, I would take the pre-assessment if it was available, if not I would find a similar test online to evaluate my knowledge level. Then, I would take notes on anything I did poorly on or was just curious about before taking the final. </p>
